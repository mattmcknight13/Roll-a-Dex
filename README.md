# Project Overview
Allow user to quickly build a NPC docket(character sheet), either by generating a random one, or by inputting specfic information, which will then be appended to the API to help increase options for later randomly generated characters

## Project Name

Roll-a-Dex

## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Create a Button that randomly generates a NPC character
- Create a form to Manually create some to all aspects of a NPC character traits to the API

- have Game Stats (Dex,Con,Int) randomly generated and/ or randomly applied using Standard array of Stats [15,14,13,12,10,8] have proper Modifiers applied

- Once a Character is made through either means move to a page that shows the character sheet or docket

#### PostMVP  

- Add functionality that makes sure anything in created traits are not already in list on database to avoide doubleling up.

- Increase number of traits that can be chosen from

- Default images based on some qualifier (race,sex,job)

- Add quick or long form for auto generate 

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|September 6| | Incomplete
|September 7| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|September 8| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|September 9|  Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|September 10| MVP | Incomplete
|September 11| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
